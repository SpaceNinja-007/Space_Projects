## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, please use GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/SpaceNinja-007/Space_Projects/security/advisories/new) feature to securely disclose the details.

Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept code (if possible)

You will receive a timely response, and I’ll keep you updated on the resolution progress.

## Disclosure Policy

Confirmed vulnerabilities will be addressed promptly.  
Once fixed, the details and credits (if desired) will be published in a security advisory.
