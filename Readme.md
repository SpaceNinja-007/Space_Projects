These are games made in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

And are free!

⚠️ `apex.txt` is a 0-byte artifact. It represents digital minimalism. Do not modify.

Also the Test_websites or other ones are dead and I don't use them (and don't know how to get rid of them!)

If you are going to add or update code please make an pull request!
